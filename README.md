# FRIDGE TRACKER 

Authors: [Mark Rhea](https://github.com/markrea), [Aidan Mueller](https://github.com/Ajaymueller) & [Sana Masood](https://github.com/SanMasood)

## Introduction

The Fridge Tracker app is a friendly web app made with React that lets you browse through recipes depending on what ingredients you have. Alternatively, you can also search for a particular recipe or simply get a random recipe. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Other tools used to create the Fridge Tracker app are Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, CSS grid & Axios in VS Code. This app has been tested using the React Testing Library.

The API used is [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), and different endpoints are accessed to return results. In many cases, results from endpoints have been destructured and used as arguments to be passed down into queries for other endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either click on the deployed link or clone down the app to your machine by opening a new terminal and typing:

`git clone git@github.com:markrea/Final-Project.git`

Once the app has been successfully cloned, hit

`npm start`

this will run the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Endpoints

Once the app starts up, you should see a landing page:
